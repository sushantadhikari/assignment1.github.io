		<h2>My Educational Experience</h2>

In present day, technologies arre developing rapidly so, it also has a great scope in future.

		<h2>Experience In My Webpage</h2>
		<p class="second">
			Making a website or designing the web pages are like a creative thing for me. while making the web pages we use our own design and creativity to make it attractive and more user friendly. Using different properties like CSS3 properties in making web page and making it beautifull is one of the intresting job to do. Keeping different pictures, backgrounds, buttons, colours makes it more attractive. Using colours in web page which makes eye friendly and using picture with different shape and size makes it more attractive to look. Text effetcts, box effects like text shadow, box sahdow makes more likable and 3d in look.
