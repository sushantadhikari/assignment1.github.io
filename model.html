		This is our first web page assignment of term one. In this assignment we used HTML and CSS. It is a solo assignment so, I used my own technique and design to complete the assignment. In term one we  were taught about creating web page by using Html and CSS only so, in my web page no any ohter tools like javascript is used to complete it. According to the the assignment we must create 6 web pages linked with each other. We must'nt copy any others design. We should use our own design and technique. All the web pages must be responsive which can be view properly from any other media devices. The web pages seem to be attractive for the  good grading. It was very difficult to create a good web pages so I learned from diiferent tutorial website of making web pages. I learned different techniques to create it and make it more attractive. Advanced CSS are used in it. Many information were gained from the friends also but not copied from them. First, the wireframes of web pages were made to analyze how to make it. Then using HTML and CSS properties it was desigend in my computer using tool sublime text. CSS properties like flex, border-radius, border style, box-shadow properties were used. Many problems were faced during creating web pages like, the points to be written were not in order so margin-left, margin-right were used to solve that and make it in proper order. As all the web pages were created it sould be kept on Github by making our own repository for making it view from any other devices also. Like this I created my web page about personal informationn.

		Analysis and wireframes should be done before creating the webpages. First of all, I thaught about the design that should be done in web pages and made some sample wirerames of each web pages, all about the logo, images, description, header part, section part and footer part. After the wireframes are made, web pages were start to create. The pictures of wireframes are given below:
